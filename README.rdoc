This release can be used a base for any Rails app that does not need a database.

A couple of things to bear in mind:

* check the gemfile for gems that might not be needed (e.g. sparql)
* docker has been set up to work locally but check docker-compose, dockerfile and makefile
and change "members-prototype" to the name of the new app
* change the name of the app inside the json file in aws_ecs and also possibly change the
host_port in there
